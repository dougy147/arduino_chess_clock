# arduino_chess_clock
This code is made to create a chess clock based on Arduino. Some components are needed such as : 
- Arduino UNO
- 3 push-up buttons
- 8digits LED display
- wires
- time!
- facultative : battery holder to emancipate your clock from the usb current
- facultative : a buzzer so you an be adverted when your time runs out

I will soon share the wiring part (how to assemble each items) with schemas.
Also, I'll share some links to buy the components I suggested at the beginning of the readme.

Maybe I'll add some comments so the code'll be more comprehensible
