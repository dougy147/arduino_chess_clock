# arduino_chess_clock
This code is made to create a chess clock based on Arduino. Some components are needed such as : 
- Arduino UNO
- 3 push-up buttons
- 7digits LED display
- wires
- 3 resistors 10kÎ©
- time!

- facultative : battery holder to emancipate your clock from the usb current
- facultative : a buzzer so you an be adverted when your time runs out


Also, I'll share some links to buy the components I suggested at the beginning of the readme.

Maybe I'll add some comments so the code'll be more comprehensible


update :
added the schema for the wiring part (see schema.jpg)
