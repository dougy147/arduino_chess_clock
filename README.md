# arduino_chess_clock
This code, basically and roughly written, is to be loaded in Arduino hardware and will make it act as a chess clock. Some components are needed : 
- Arduino (this code has only been tested on Arduino UNO)
- 3 push buttons
- 7digits LED display
- A bunch of wires
- 3 resistors 10kÎ©
- Facultative : battery holder to emancipate your clock from usb current need.
- Facultative : a buzzer so you'll  be warned when your time runs out.

last_update :
added the schema for the wiring part (see schema.jpg)
